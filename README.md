## About me 🙂

I am a self-taught Mobile Developer from 🇪🇸, currently working as an Android Developer at [@Klikin](https://www.klikin.com/).

I usually dedicate my free time to improve my knowledge of Kotlin and Swift.

Mainly to create, improve and maintain my own applications, which are 100% native and made in Compose and SwiftUI
respectively.

Feel free to explore further details about me and my projects on my [website](https://jargcode.com).
